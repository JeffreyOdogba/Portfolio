              Hi, I am Jeffrey, a Front-end(React) and Back-end (C#) Developer

              After my previous profession experience, I tried besting at my
              hobby which was bodybuliding sport, and I am glad I won couple of
              bodybuliding competitions in Toronto.

              Recently, I studied Software Engineering at Sheridan College. By
              focusing and enhancing my knowledge once again. I regain my skills
              and increased learning which has brought me this far and still
              improving on my skills.

              In a world of changes and everything been accessible with just a
              click, Programming has made us masters of controlling and making
              Objects seems more realistic and define the word "Everything is
              Possible". IT is the new World and I have no doubt that it makes
              the world a faster and better!.
